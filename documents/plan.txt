#Documentation

- Stock class

The stock class takes a stock symbol e.g(TSLA), and
creates an object that contains all neccessary
information about the corresponding stock, such
as ask and bid prices and sizes, name and dayHigh/Lows.

- Purchase class

The purchase class is a class used to perform
purchases, it takes a stock object, amount and an
owner id. It has two methods,
validate() and completePurchase().

The validate method ensures that the stockmarket is
open, that there is an askSize and that the askPrice
is not 0. Returns true or false

The compeltePurchase method takes money from the user
wallet and adds a new row to the ActiveStocks table
with the correct information.
If the user does not have enough money in their
wallet it will retun false, otherwise it will return 
true.
